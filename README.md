# Preprocessing
The motive of this repository is to create templates with all possible data preprocessing steps for each Machine Learning algorithm. 
All the steps may not be required based on the nature of data and thus they can be easily commented.

It is better to have everything in place than miss something essential.

Note: It is possible that in future these steps become redundant as scikit-learn evolves.
